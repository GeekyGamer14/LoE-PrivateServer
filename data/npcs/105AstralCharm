# State 0 : Send the player talking to Spud
label 0-start
say Okay, listen. I ran a few tests, and it's probably safe, but I did have a few complications with the formula that didn't present themselves until after the field test, so I need you to go talk to Spud for me and make sure the specimens stay isolated. 
answer 0-explain1 Specimens? Symptoms?
answer 0-explain1 Hold on. What's this about?
answer 0-cancel I can't help. I'm in a hurry.

label 0-explain1
say I just ran a little test on some of his carrots, okay? And it worked like a charm, I'll have you know. He'll have no trouble identifying the ones I used, because they grew to about the size of watermelons. It was a complete success. He just, well, shouldn't eat them or sell them or anything. There was this one little side-effect that he couldn't have known about. That's all. 
answer 0-explain2 You didn't tell him you were going to do this in advance?
answer 0-explain4 What side-effect would that be?

label 0-explain2
say Well, not exactly, but that's only because he wouldn't let me back onto his property after that last giant robot incident. I don't really have a lot of options for this kind of thing. It's not like I can just grow my own carrots whenever I need to. 
answer 0-explain3 That's terrible! You should be put in a dungeon!

label 0-explain3
say Can we worry about this later? I'm trying to help him! And somepony's health might be at stake! 
answer 0-explain4 What about the side-effect you mentioned?

label 0-explain4
say I mean, again, it's probably nothing to worry about, but if anyone has tried eating the carrots, just make sure they get tested for lymphatic fillyriasis as soon as they can. Although the chances of that happening just from eating my artificially enhanced produce is very slim. 
answer 0-explain5 How slim?
answer 0-accept3 I'm on it!
answer 0-cancel2 You should tell him yourself. I'm not helping.

label 0-explain5
say Well, I'd say somewhere around... maybe fifteen percent? 
answer 0-accept1 FIFTEEN PERCENT?!
answer 0-accept2 That doesn't sound so bad. You could probably get away with not telling him.
answer 0-accept3 Okay, I'm on it.

label 0-accept1
setQuestState 2
say Just go.

setQuestState 2
say You'd be amazed at how many hoops you have to jump through to have an experiment considered "ethical." It seems like half of the scientific community exists solely to make sure they can shun or imprison themselves and everyone around them at any opportunity. Also, somepony could get pretty sick. You had really better get going.

setQuestState 2
say Okay, thanks. And I can reimburse whomever I need to after all this is taken care of. 
end

label 0-cancel
say Hmph.
end

label 0-cancel2
setQuestState 1
say I can't just tell him myself because I'm not allowed on the property, genius. If you're not going to help me, I'll just find somepony who will.
end

# State 1 : We didn't accept the first time
label 0-alt-start
say I have nothing to say to you. 
answer 0-alt-accept1 I decided I'd talk to Spud for you after all.
answer 0-alt-cancel Right then. Goodbye.

label 0-alt-accept1
say So do it.
answer 0-alt-accept2 Yes, ma'am.
answer 0-alt-accept3 Well, fine, then!

label 0-alt-accept2
setQuestState 2
end

label 0-alt-accept3
say Fine!
answer 0-alt-accept4 FINE! I'M GOING!

label 0-alt-accept4
say WELL, GOOD!
answer 0-alt-accept5 ...yeah. That's right.

label 0-alt-accept5
setQuestState 2
say Hmph.

# State 2 : We need to go talk to Spud
label 0-accepted
say You're supposed to be talking to Spud, not me. I already know. 
end

# State 3 : We just talked to Spud and need to talk to Flan
label 0-talkedToSpud
say So, did you tell him? 
answer 0-spudflan-explain1 Yes. He was pretty angry. He might have threatened you a little.
answer 0-spudflan-explain2 I told him.

label 0-spudflan-explain1
say I can't say that surprises me. Well, thanks for your help, at least. I suppose your work here is done. ...And now I've got to think of another way to make it up to him too. A scientist's work is just never done. 
answer 0-spudflan-accept1 Okay. Later.
answer 0-spudflan-accept2 Don't I get a reward?
answer 0-spudflan-accept2 Is there anything I can do to help?
answer 0-spudflan-accept2 Maybe you should just leave him alone.

label 0-spudflan-accept1
end

label 0-spudflan-accept2
say ...No
end

label 0-spudflan-explain2
say How'd he take it? 
answer 0-spudflan-explain1 Not particularly well.

# State 4 : We just talked to Flan, need to talk to Wanda
label 0-talkedToFlan
say You've got things to be doing, so do them!
